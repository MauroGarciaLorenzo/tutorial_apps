[Body]
== Description ==
BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) is an algorithm for comparing primary biological sequence information, such as the amino-acid sequences of different proteins or nucleotides of DNA sequences. BLAST enables a researcher to compare a query sequence with a library or database of sequences, and identify sequences that resemble the query sequence above a certain threshold.

The COMPSs application contains three main blocks:

- Split: the query sequences file is splitted in N fragments.

- Alignment: each sequence fragment is compared against the database by the blast binary.

- Assembly: assembly process combines all intermediate files into a single result file.


== Execution instructions ==
Usage:
runcompss blast.Blast <debug> <binary> <database> <sequences> <#fragments> <tmpdir> <output> <cmd_args>

where:
		 * - debug: Set the debug mode on
		 * - binary: Blast binary location
		 * - database: Database Name
		 * - sequences: Input sequences path
		 * - #fragments: Fragments number
		 * - tmpdir: Temporary directory
		 * - output: Output file
		 * - cmd_args: Command line Arguments of the Blast binary


== Execution Example ==
runcompss blast.Blast true /home/compss/tutorial_apps/java/blast/binary/blastall /sharedDisk/Blast/databases/swissprot/swissprot /sharedDisk/Blast/sequences/sargasso_test.fasta 8 /tmp/ /home/compss/out.txt


== Build ==
=== Option 1: Native java ===
cd ~/tutorial_apps/java/blast/; javac src/main/java/blast/*.java
cd src/main/java/; jar cf blast.jar blast/
cd ../../../; mv src/main/java/blast.jar jar/

=== Option 2: Maven ===
cd ~/tutorial_apps/java/blast/
mvn clean package
